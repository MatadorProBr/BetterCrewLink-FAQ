**RIP BetterCrewLink-FAQ**

**2020-2021**

Another warning that is not that important but, probably I will stop this FAQ, I will explain why, on a beautiful day there I was while making some changes to BetterCrewLink with pull requests until I receive an email from OhMyGuus (owner of BetterCrewLink) invited me to be a contributor to the project, that is, edit some things, and I accepted and with that he asked me to try to make a [wiki on GitHub](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/wiki), and with that I will start to migrate everything that is here to the [BetterCrewLink wiki](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/wiki), and when the migration is over, I will archive this FAQ, thanks to everyone who starred in the project.

Edit: Everything was migrated to the BetterCrewLink Wiki, now if you want to see the FAQ [click here](https://github.com/OhMyGuus/BetterCrewLink/wiki), then I think this is goodbye, thanks to everyone who starred in the project, goodbye project that I updated every day so everyone would be happy.
